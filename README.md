# Big-Number-Multiplication-Data-Structures-Project

 - This program multiplies numbers as big as ur ram can handle and stores the result in a .txt file.The only limiting factor is speed though due to my algorithm being 
a Tetha(n^2) algorithm.
- It can multiply two 10000 digit numbers in seconds though.
